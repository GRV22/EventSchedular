This Project is scheduling Events and inviting Guests.
CRUD operations are supported for Events.

To perform these basic operations.

I used these Technologies:
1) Google Calendar APIs
2) Google APIs dashboard
3) Spring MVC

To use project :
1) Create Project and select the APIs you want to use.
2) Create Google Service Account.
3) Copy the private key Credentials to "resources" folder.
4) Update the Application details in config.properties in "resources" folder.
